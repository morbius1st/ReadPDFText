CreatePDFBoxes 
* uses the saved box information to create sample sheets
	used to validate the rect information scanned

CreatePDFElements
* test routines to develope PDF element creation

CreatePDFSamples 
* uses the saved box information(v2) to create sample sheets
	used to validate the rect information scanned

ExtractPdfText
* tests how to extract text from a pdf

ReadPDFManager
* test - shows the pre-created sample information (not scanned)

ReadPDFText
* primary program - but tests various methods to create the final PDF based on sample and pre-created information

ReadPDFTextTests
* test how to extract text from a pdf / scan boxes / save data to the file (data saved to file may be in the wrong format)

ScanPDFBoxes
* scan's a pdf with location boxes and saves the information to an xml file (used by CreatePDFBoxes and others)

ManagePDFSheetDwg
* nothing


TO DO

projects
PDFSheets
* prepares and processes PDF drawing sheet files
	> primary sheet list storage system is via excel file
	> user operations
		* NON-PROGRAM operations
			* user creates a sheet dwg list in Revit with the correct parameters (TBD) [e.g. header1, header2, etc./ sheet number / sheet title / sheet format / + flags such as "ignore"]
			* user exports the sheet dwg list to excel / csv file.
			* user imports the sheet dwg list CSV file to a sheet dwg list excel file and adjusts if needed - needs to be sorted in header1, header2, etc order
	> operation 1
		* validate sheet dwg list excel file
			* look for missing fields
	> operation 2
		* scan PDF sheet files to create an excel file - use file name to create list - to allow user to assign sheet configuration files
		* alternate to user operations
		* look for issues
			* sheet name in wrong format
	> operation 3
		* validate excel file versus PDF file names in the folder
		?? note, for now, all PDF sheet files go into a single folder but can be in sub-folders
		* look for mis-matches
			* excel has a file but folder does not
			* folder has a file but excel does not
	> operation 4
		* validate the sheet dwg list versus the information in the PDF file
			> the SheetData file / list will be needed
		* look for mis-matches
			* SheetDwgList has sheet numbers / sheet names not in the folder
			* folder has files with sheet numbers / sheet names not in the SheetDwgList
	> operation 5
		* create the Pdf Tree
